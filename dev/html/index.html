      <h1>OUR STORY</h1>

      <p><strong>Vault + Vine is the re-envisioning of Peicha Chang’s Falls Flowers. After spending the last five years at their little storefront around the corner on Conrad Street, Peicha and her team have outgrown the space and have committed to their new location here on Midvale to offer an immersive retail experience while providing the community with a cafe, gathering place, and small scale event venue.</strong></p>

      <img class= "img-1" src="/deploy/img/our-story/heroimage.png" alt="our shop">

      <p>Our customers are friends and neighbors who, over the years, have become family. Local creators, whose hands are part of every process of making their goods, produce many of the objects we carry. The seasonal flowers we use in our arrangements are grown in and around Philadelphia at small farms, and are harvested and delivered to us by the same farmers who planted the seeds. Any of our products or flowers not locally produced or grown are always sourced responsibly and ethically. </p>

      <p>Our hope is that Vault + Vine becomes for each person who walks through the door what it has become for us: an urban oasis in the East Falls neighborhood of Philadelphia; an atmosphere of abundance and respite; a space for beauty, whimsy, and rejuvenation.</p>

            <p>Falls Flowers was the first floral-retail and event design studio to ‘live” sustainably as one of 1,600+ businesses worldwide that is a certified B-Corp, and Vault + Vine aims to continue that legacy.</p>

            <p>A B-Corp is a for-profit company certified by the nonprofit B Lab to meet rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency. Our motto is “People using business as a force for good,’ with a focus on a triple bottom line: people, planet, AND profit. </p>
